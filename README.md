PharmaSonic
===========
I got carried away with my senior design project and continued working on it. It serves as a great example of how to connect a data-visualization tool
## Background
The pharmaceutical sector is expressing an increasing interest in modern non-destructive testing techniques. They are using new technologies and materials that require strict quality control. One such method that is quick, safe, and reliable involves using ultrasound transducers to find the speed of sound in a pharmaceutical tablet. The speed of sound can be related to important material properties called elastic constants. Using the relationships that these elastic constants represent, important material properties such as weight, thickness, and hardness can be calculated.
## Problem
Create an off-the-line pill tester that can test pharmaceutical tablets for weight, thickness, and hardness. Using two sets of ultrasound transducers (one that emits shear wave sound and one that emits longitudinal wave sound), we can get two different elastic modulus. With two different elastic modulus, we can calculate all five of them. From there, the rest should be cake... (assuming an isotropic homogeneous medium bla bla)
## Arduino
Okay, on to the project details. One thing this website does is control an Arduino prototype (pictures and video to come). The Arduino interfaces with a stepper motor, two solenoid, and two pressure sensors. The user downloads and runs the BreakoutJS program and that connects the Arduino to a websocket. The websocket is then controlled through simple jQuery (seen in this project). The data and controls are then presented to the user using Bootstrap, some more jQuery, and Highcharts (a data visualization Javascript library).
## Tektronix
The piezoelectric ultrasound transducers are driven using a square wave pulser (possibly tuned to a resonant state by someone before me). The analog signal is then converted into a digital signal by a Tektronix oscilloscope (TDS3000). Using the Tektronix API and networking the computer that is running BreakoutJS (and the web server) into a local private network, data is extracted. The website can interpret both pulses and spectral envelopes. It also includes an algorithm that generates the highest possible resolution signal by zooming in, collecting the data, and then zooming into the next appropriate data collection region.
## More About the Prototype
+ Stepper motor uses an acceleration ramping profile to maintain adaquete torque and decrease the time it takes the prototype to successfully maneuver the tablets
+ Stepper motor provides high resolution turning accuracy along with high torque using a 200-step 2A/coil step motor that is driven with a Pololu DRV8825 which provides 32 microsteps per step
+ The force that the solenoid exerts is controlled by pulse-width modulation (e.g. 50% on, 50% off at a high frequency)
+ Force sensors (strain gauges) are connected using integrated circuits that eliminate the need for complex op-amps (TI INA125P)
## Issues
+ Connectivity to the oscilloscope is established using AJAX calls in Javascript - older versions of the TDS3000 that do not add "Allow Cross Origin: *" into their HTTP header will not be able to connect to the website unless the web browser is run with security features off
+ Appears to only work with the latest version of Google Chrome
## Future Features
These are features I plan on implementing:
+ Ability to download data as a CSV (this will require hosting the website on a host that requires PHP)
+ Upload oscilloscope settings file/download oscilloscope settings file
+ Magic button that combines all the features into a 5-10 second demonstration
+ Connect to device over VPN
+ 
Features that I would implement if anyone ever became interested in this project:
+ Recompile BreakoutJS executable to include connectivity with the Tektronix API
+ Integrate with Digital Ocean API to spin up 32-server instance and run data through R for computing (Seewave in particular)
